# ðŸ’– Heart Disease Prediction App ðŸš€

This is a **machine learning-powered web application** that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user input. Built using **Streamlit**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- User-friendly web interface for heart disease prediction
- Uses a trained **Random Forest Model** to classify heart disease risk
- Data preprocessing with **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance
- Real-time predictions with **Streamlit**
- Fully deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**
